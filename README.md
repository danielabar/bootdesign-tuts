# Designing in the Browser with Bootstrap

My notes and project from Tuts Plus course [Designing in the Browser with Bootstrap](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/designing-in-the-browser-with-bootstrap)

Basic idea: Skip the photoshopping, and use jump straight into the browser to try different colors, layouts etc.

[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables) is used for rapid prototyping.

## Grid System

To use the grid system, must be in a div with class of `container` or `container-fluid`.

Both are responsive, but `container-fluid` expands and contracts,
whereas `container` has a set of fixed widths it breaks on.

Column classes go inside a div with class of `row`

To take up the full width of a row, make the columns add up to 12.

Any content in a cell will keep its width, and expand in height.
