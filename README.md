## Grid System

To use the grid system, must be in a div with class of `container` or `container-fluid`.

Both are responsive, but `container-fluid` expands and contracts, 
whereas `container` has a set of fixed widths it breaks on.

Column classes go inside a div with class of `row`

To take up the full width of a row, make the columns add up to 12.

Any content in a cell will keep its width, and expand in height.
